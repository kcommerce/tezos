(** This module introduces the semantics of Proof-generating Virtual Machines.

   A PVM defines an operational semantics for some computational
   model. The specificity of PVMs, in comparison with standard virtual
   machines, is their ability to generate and to validate a *compact*
   proof that a given atomic execution step turned a given state into
   another one.

   In the smart-contract rollups, PVMs are used for two purposes:

    - They allow for the externalization of rollup execution by
      completely specifying the operational semantics of a given
      rollup. This standardization of the semantics gives a unique and
      executable source of truth about the interpretation of
      smart-contract rollup inboxes, seen as a transformation of a rollup
      state.

    - They allow for the validation or refutation of a claim that the
      processing of some messages led to a given new rollup state (given
      an actual source of truth about the nature of these messages).

       The state of the PVM denotes a state of the rollup.

       We classify states into two categories: "internal states" do
       not require any external information to be executed while
       "input states" are waiting for some information from the
       inbox to be executable.

  *)
  type state

  (** A state is initialized in a given context. A [context]
      represents the executable environment needed by the state to
      exist. Typically, the rollup node storage can be part of this
      context to allow the PVM state to be persistent. *)

  (** A [hash] characterizes the contents of a state. *)

  (**

      During interactive rejection games, a player may need to
      provide a proof that a given execution step described as
      a pair of a [hash] for the state before the execution step
      and a [hash] for the state right after the execution step
      is valid.

      The protocol only has to verify proofs. Hence, this signature
      does not include a function to produce proofs. However, a
      rollup node would necessarily offer a richer interface for its
      own implementation of the PVM typically to be able to generate
      such proofs when it participates in a refutation game.

  *)
  type proof

  (** [proof]s are embedded in L1 refutation game operations using
      [proof_encoding]. Given that the size of L1 operations are
      limited, it is of *critical* importance to make sure that
      no execution step of the PVM can generate proofs that do not
      fit in L1 operations when encoded. If such a proof existed,
      the rollup could get stuck. *)
  val proof_encoding : proof Data_encoding.t

  (** [verify_proof input proof] returns [true] iff the [proof] is
      valid. If the state is an input state, [input] is the inbox
      message provided to the evaluation function. *)

  val state_hash : state -> hash Lwt.t

  (** [initial_state context boot_sector] is the state of the PVM
     before booting. *)

  (** [is_input_state state] returns [Some (level, counter)] if
      [state] is an input state waiting for the input message that
      comes next to the message numbered [counter] in the inbox of a
      given [level]. By convention, waiting for the very first message
      is represented by [Some (0, -1)]. *)
  val is_input_state : state -> (Raw_level.t * Z.t) option Lwt.t

  (** [set_input input state] sets [input] in [state] as the next
      input message to be processed. The input message must be the
      message next to the previous message processed by the rollup
      in the inbox. *)
  val set_input : input -> state -> state Lwt.t

  (** [eval s0] returns a state [s1] resulting from the
      execution of an atomic step of the rollup at state [s0]. *)
